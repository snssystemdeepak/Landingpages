                with Pedestrian Detection (PD) is designed to determine if impact is imminent and help reduce impact
                speed and damage in certain frontal collisions involving a vehicle, a pedestrian, a bicycle, or a
                motorcyclist. PCS w/PD is not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. System effectiveness depends
                on many factors, such as speed, size and position of pedestrian or bicyclist and weather, light and road
                conditions. See Owner's Manual for limitations.</br>* <span

                Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist is designed to read visible lane markers under certain
                conditions. It provides a visual/audible alert and slight steering force when lane departure is
                detected. It is not a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">collision-avoidance</span> system or a
                substitute for safe and attentive driving. Effectiveness depends on many factors including road, weather
                and vehicle conditions. See Owner’s Manual for limitations.</br>* The Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) lane
                centering function is designed to read visible lane markers and detect other vehicles under certain
                conditions. It is only operational when DRCC is engaged. See Owner's Manual for limitations.</br>*
                Dynamic Radar Cruise Control is not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. See Owner’s Manual for

                limitations.</br>* Automatic High Beams operate at speeds above 21 MPH. See Owner’s Manual for
                instructions and limitations.</br>* Proactive Driving Assist (PDA) is designed to detect certain objects
                or curves in the road and provide gentle braking and/or steering support. PDA is not a substitute for
                safe and attentive driving. System effectiveness depends on many factors, such as speed, size and
                position of detected objects and weather, light and road conditions. See Owner’s Manual for additional
                limitations and details.</br>* Use only if aware of circumstances surrounding vehicle it is legal safe
                to do so (e.g., do not remotely start a gas engine vehicle in an enclosed space or if vehicle is
